# Express API Project ðŸš†

In this project I created an API using Express. My API has a couple of RESTful endpoints which returns some arrays of data and a single item.

## In this project, you will find:

- API built in Node using Express
- Routes in Express
- Data manipulation in JavaScript - selecting and filtering arrays

## Tools/ techniques, approach and planning ðŸ”¨

I created a RESTful API based on the books.json data. If I had more time, I would create a frontend that uses my API. Additionally, I would implement 'pages' using `.slice()` to return only a selection of results from the array and I would handle if item doesn't exist and return some useful data in the response.
